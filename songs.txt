Song : Bruises
Lyrics :
Counting days, counting days since my love up and got lost on me
And every breath that I've been taken since you left feels like a waste on me
I've been holding on to hope that you'll come back when you can find some peace
Cause every word that I've heard spoken since you left feels like a hollow street

I've been told, I've been told to get you off my mind
But I hope I never lose the bruises that you left behind
Oh my lord, oh my lord, I need you by my side

There must be something in the water
Cause everyday it's getting colder
And if only I could hold you
You'd keep my head from going under

Maybe I, maybe I'm just being blinded by the brighter side
Of what we had because it's over, well there must be something in the tide

I've been told, I've been told to get you off my mind
But I hope I never lose the bruises that you left behind
Oh my lord, oh my lord, I need you by my side

There must be something in the water
Cause everyday it's getting colder
And if only I could hold you
You'd keep my head from going under

It's your love I'm lost in
Your love I'm lost in
Your love I'm lost in
And I'm tired of being so exhausted
Your love I'm lost in
Your love I'm lost in
Your love I'm lost in
Even though I'm nothing to you now
Even though I'm nothing to you now

There must be something in the water
Cause everyday it's getting colder
And if only I could hold you
You'd keep my head from going under

There must be something in the water
Cause everyday it's getting colder
And if only I could hold you
You'd keep my head from going under

Song : Falling
Lyrics :
I'm in my bed
And you're not here
And there's no one to blame but the drink and my wandering hands

Forget what I said
It's not what I meant
And I can't take it back
I can't unpack the baggage you left

What am I now?
What am I now?
What if I'm someone I don't want around?
I'm falling again
I'm falling again
I'm falling

What if I'm down?
What if I'm out?
What if I'm someone you won't talk about?
I'm falling again
I'm falling again
I'm falling

You said you cared
And you missed me too
And I'm well aware I write too many songs about you

And the coffee's out
At the Beachwood Cafe
And it kills me 'cause I know we've run out of things we can say

What am I now?
What am I now?
What if I'm someone I don't want around?
I'm falling again
I'm falling again
I'm falling

What if I'm down?
What if I'm out?
What if I'm someone you won't talk about?
I'm falling again
I'm falling again
I'm falling

And I get the feeling that you'll never need me again

What am I now?
What am I now?
What if you're someone I just want around?
I'm falling again
I'm falling again
I'm falling

What if I'm down?
What if I'm out?
What if I'm someone you won't talk about?
I'm falling again
I'm falling again
I'm falling

Song : Happy
Lyrics :
It might seem crazy what I'm about to say
Sunshine she's here, you can take a break
I'm a hot air balloon that could go to space
With the air, like I don't care, baby, by the way

Uh

Song : Go For G!
Lyrics :
Gorillas in the jungle
Gazelles out in the field
Goats are in the barnyard
And gophers in their holes
Go go go go for G
Go go go go for G
You'll feel glorious, generous, gleeful and great
When you go go go go for G
Goofballs in their go-carts
Girl scouts chewing gum
Grandma with her gingerbread
And the drummer plays a gong
Go go go go for G
Go go go go for G
You'll feel gracious, gigantic, grateful and glad
When you go go go go for G
Grapes, glue, gyroscopes
Go go go go for G
Go go go go for G
You'll feel glorious, generous, gleeful and great
When you go go go go for G

Song : ...As The Future Repeats Today
Lyrics :
For so long I tried to be like you,
Pushed aside with no time to evolve..

There's no place that still remains
Just deserted space all left in grey
Why did we lose, the knowledge of time?
Is this the price, the hell we pay?
The poisoned fear known to man
is he who try to find his path
The collective force blaming you
"This is day day we split in half"

Thrown to the gallow, forgotten and sore
sworn to be different in what way I can
The sultry taste that is special to me
is the last gleeful glimpse of a bitter man

Down and troubled, in search for better days
Back to the beginning, I'm at the end again
All my time, compressed to itching moments
as the future repeats today

So impressed, lost the faith in all I had
Broken down, I'm on my way to be dissolved

The hopes and prays of things to come
I've lost them all with glory
Urgent to aim for that short-lived joy
I see gold in all that lies before me

And so we ignore the baggers cup
Praise your act in the Grand Finale
Teach the unborn the winners sign
a welcome grin to the world Royal

Down and troubled, in search for better days
Back to the beginning, I'm at the end again
All my time, compressed to itching moments
as the future repeats today

Down and troubled, in search for better days
Back to the beginning, I'm at the end again
All my time, compressed to itching moments
as the future repeats today

Song : Love
Lyrics :
Pitch black, sparkling
Truthful desires
Hurts me with your silence
Until we reunite
Hear my gleeful yearning
Forever bound to try

Take me to the end of the world
Flee with me to the end
Lay me down in the arms of the night
Dance with me once we're there

When in love, when in love with the darkness
All is lost to a bitter embrace
When in love, when in love with the darkness
All that's left of you will fade

Death, requite my love
Soon I'll be your muse
Death, requite my love
Soon to be consumed

Take me to the end of the world
Flee with me to the end
Lay me down in the arms of the night
Dance with me once we're there

Purge me with your violence until we are as one
Ceasing to exist I'm forever bound to you

Take me to the underworld
Sleep with me till the end

And finally, death do us part
From the world silence in the dark
Silently rid me of pain
Forever, give to me your name
Love...

Song : Jellyfish
Lyrics :
Here comes that ten you've been yearning for
Look at your lips and face them to the door
Heels on cobblestones satisfy better than your cocky tone
Break old habits, you're enraptured by your ego

I wanna be the new, the old, not something inbetween
I wanna be the fruit, the juice, enough to fascinate me
I wanna be the light, euphoric, stop beating myself up
I wanna be the light, euphoric, stop beating myself up
I wanna be the light, euphoric, stop beating myself up
I wanna be the light, euphoric, stop beating myself up
I wanna be the light

I see it's scary but collapse in my heart
Oh no, it's time to go, got to make a winter body
If and how we mend our conscious [?]

I wanna be the new, the old, not something inbetween
I wanna be the fruit, the juice, enough to fascinate me
I wanna be the light, euphoric, stop beating myself up
I wanna be the light, euphoric, stop beating myself up
I wanna be the light, euphoric, stop beating myself up
I wanna be the light, euphoric, stop beating myself up
I wanna be the light

Jellyfish, jellyfish
I'm scared oj jealousy, jealousy
And yet I wanna swim in a sea
That's full of ah, ah, ah

Song : Your Cure
Lyrics :
Somehow we fell in
And there's no way out
And no way in for any one else

But we've forgotten
What this was all about
And now I've lost you through self doubt

Fate used to be just knowing that I'd always find you
Guess destiny don't always come true
I try to remember how euphoric your skin felt
When I was so sure
That you were my cure

I'm searching for you
But this time maybe
I could be that you've actually lost me

Fate used to be just knowing that I'd always find you
Guess destiny don't always come true
I try to remember how euphoric your skin felt
When I was so sure
That you were my cure

Fate used to be just knowing that I'd always find you
Guess destiny don't always come true
I try to remember how euphoric your skin felt
Fate used to be just knowing that I'd always find you
Guess destiny don't always come true
I try to remember how euphoric your skin felt
When I was so sure
That you were my cure
That I was your cure
That you were my cure

Song : She And I
Lyrics :
Tread upon me lightly
And take what you will
Cause it's yours anyway
You may have read up on me slightly
But if looks could kill
Then I died today
A challenge to you only
Can you remember my
Most honest face?
And I'd be less so lonely
Whenever I
Ordain to chase

The mystery
You bring from me
And I am persuaded
And from your eyes
Came a sweet reply
So utterly unmasqueraded

Morning rush hour I can see
She used her eyes but she saw me
Euphoric streaks upon the sky
They celebrate us she and I

Tread upon me deeply
And handle with care
Because I just might break
And if I put it less discreetly
Enter if you dare
But make no mistake
If I stop beneath your window
To ply my wares
And serenade
It wouldn't hardly dare begin to
Imply my prayers
I haven't prayed

In some time
I have been resigned
To have settled back and waited
But from your eyes
A sweet reply so beautifully paraded

Morning rush hour I can see
She used her eyes but she saw me
Euphoric streaks upon the sky
They celebrate she and I

Morning rush hour I can see
She used her eyes but she saw me
Euphoric streaks upon the sky
They celebrate she and I

Song : I'm Blessed
Lyrics :

I knew God was, was with me
I always use to pray, ah
My prayer was I asked God to not to let the devil kill me out here
While I was in the streets before I could get back
But I said if you give me one more chance at life and music
I promise you I'm gon' shout you out
And I'm gon' testify
And we gon' have a little church up in there
Oh, oh, oh, I'm blessed

Wakin' up, thankin' God
Every day is feelin' just like Sunday
Wifey fly, by my side
Green light, everything is going my way
Ridin' clean, livin' dreams
Just left the barber and I'm feelin' like Midas
Heard him say, give Him praise
What's in the water gotcha actin' like this

Ain't a day go by, that I don't try
To thank the Lord up above
And if you wonder why I'm lovin' life
Come close and I'll tell you what's up (Listen)

Ask me how I'm doing, I'm blessed, yes
Living every moment, no regrets
Smile up on my face, I'm like oh
Yes, I'm blessed yes, I'm blessed, yes
Ask me how I'm doing, I'm blessed yes
Living every moment no regrets
Smile up on my face, I'm like oh
Yes, I'm blessed yes, I'm blessed, yes

Playin' cards, laughin' hard
Barbecuin' waking up the whole block
Music loud, turnin' out
Little kids are breakin' out the bus stop
Life is good, really good
And every moment, no I can't forget
I gotta say, I won't change
You're the reason that I am like this

Ain't a day go by, that I don't try
To thank the Lord up above
And if you wonder why I'm lovin' life
Come close and I'll tell you what's up (Listen)

Ask me how I'm doing, I'm blessed, yes
Living every moment, no regrets
Smile up on my face, I'm like oh
Yes, I'm blessed, yes, I'm blessed, yes

Ask me how I'm doing, I'm blessed yes
Living every moment no regrets
Smile up on my face, I'm like oh
Yes, I'm blessed, yes, I'm blessed, yes I'm blessed
I'm blessed, I'm blessed, I'm blessed
I'm blessed, I'm blessed, I'm blessed
I'm blessed, I'm blessed, I'm blessed
Oh, oh, oh, I'm blessed

Song : Scandal
Lyrics :
Scandal - now you've left me all the world's gonna know
Scandal - they're gonna turn our lives into a freak show

They'll see the heartache, they'll see our love break
They'll hear me pleading, I'll say for God's sake
Over and over and over again

Scandal - now you've left me there's no healing the wounds
Scandal - and all the world can make us out to be fools

Here come the bad news, open the floodgates
They'll leave us bleeding, we'll say "you cheapskates!"
Over and over and over again
Yeah

So let them know when they stare, it's just a private affair
They'll have us hung in the air and tell me what do they care
It's only a life to be twisted and broken

They'll see the heartache, they'll see our love break, yeah
They'll hear me pleading, I'll say for God's sake
Over and over and over and over again

Scandal
Scandal

Scandal - yes you're breaking my heart again
Scandal - yes it'll all and all happen again

Today the headlines, tomorrow hard times
And no one really knows the truth from the lies
And in the end the story deeper must hide
Deeper and deeper and deeper inside

Scandal
Scandal

Song : Crazy
Lyrics :
I remember when, I remember, I remember when I lost my mind
There was something so pleasant about that place.
Even your emotions had an echo
In so much space

And when you're out there
Without care,
Yeah, I was out of touch
But it wasn't because I didn't know enough
I just knew too much

Does that make me crazy?
Does that make me crazy?
Does that make me crazy?
Possibly [radio version]
probably [album version]

And I hope that you are having the time of your life
But think twice, that's my only advice

Come on now, who do you, who do you, who do you, who do you think you are,
Ha ha ha bless your soul
You really think you're in control

Well, I think you're crazy
I think you're crazy
I think you're crazy
Just like me

My heroes had the heart to lose their lives out on a limb
And all I remember is thinking, I want to be like them
Ever since I was little, ever since I was little it looked like fun
And it's no coincidence I've come
And I can die when I'm done

Maybe I'm crazy
Maybe you're crazy
Maybe we're crazy
Probably

Uh, uh
